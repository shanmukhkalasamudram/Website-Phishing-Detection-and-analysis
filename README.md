Website Phishing Detection and complete analysis of all models 


## Phishing
Due to Phishing, many users waste their money and it costs users billions of dollars per year. This luring techniques used by persons to fish for the personal data or information in a pond of unsuspecting internet users. They usually use spoofed e-mail, and software to get the personal information. They also get the confidential data like usernames and passwords. In this project we analysis the attack of phishing of websites using various Machine Learning methods like Decision tree, KNN. In this we train the models for the better understanding of the detection and keeping various parameters like security IP into the consideration. This parameters helps us to detect the phishing websites and find accurately.


### Conclusion

As we know that, any model cannot predict 100 percent accurately. Model which gives less prediction doesnâ€™t mean that the model is not correct. Based on our dataset we prefer either Supervised learning methods or Unsupervised learning methods. As per our dataset, it contains labels for each data, so we tested with various methods to predict whether a given website is attacked by phishing. As per results, It is better to use Random Forest Classifier Accuracy. It gives most accurate results.
